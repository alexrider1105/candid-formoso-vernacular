Five projects can be viewed here:
 
Saving Mr Fluffy: A Mathematical Approach -- Used data obtained from ultrasound on pet "Mr. Fluffy" to locate the position of a lethal marble stuck in the subject's digestive system. Data-processing techiniques involved include signal-averaging, the Fourier Transformation, and filtering.

Pitch Perfect: An Analytical Approach -- Recorded tune from someone playing a recorder and used it to reproduce the original music score. Data processed with Fourier Transformations and filtering done by Gabor Transformations.

Understanding Gravity: A Data-Driven Approach -- Recreated Newton's law of motion based solely on videos recording the movement of cameras. Used Principle component analysis to simplify data and the Gabor Transformation as filters.

Pitch-Perfect: A Computer-Simulated Approach -- Used clustering algorithm to train program to classify music files by genre. Clustering algorithm used is the MATLAB provided fitcdiscr.

Exploring The World: A Data-Visualization Approach -- Explored modern computer vision techniques. Used them to analyze video of pendulum behavior.
